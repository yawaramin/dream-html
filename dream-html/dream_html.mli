  type 'a ty = string -> ('a, string) result
  (** The type of a decoder for a single form field value of type ['a] which can
      successfully decode the field value or fail with an error message key. *)

  (** In the following type decoders, the minimum and maximum values are all
      {i inclusive}. *)

  val bool : bool ty
  val char : ?min:char -> ?max:char -> char ty

      Note that this is {i not} timezone-aware.

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  (** {2 Forms and fields} *)

  type 'a t
  (** The type of a form (a form field by itself is also considered a form)
      which can decode values of type ['a] or fail with a list of error message
      keys. *)

  val ok : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [ok value] is a form field that always successfully returns [value].

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val error : string -> string -> 'a t
  (** [error name message] is a form field that always errors the field [name]
      with the [message].

      These allow adding adding further checks to the entire form using all
      decoded field values and then attaching more errors to specific fields (or
      not).

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val list : ?min_length:int -> ?max_length:int -> 'a ty -> string -> 'a list t
  (** [list ?min_length ?max_length ty name] is a form field which can decode a
      list of values which can each be decoded by [ty]. The list must have at
      least [min_length] and at most [max_length] (inclusive). *)

  val optional : 'a ty -> string -> 'a option t
  (** [optional ty name] is a form field which can decode an optional value from
      the form. *)

  val required : ?default:'a -> 'a ty -> string -> 'a t
  (** [required ?default ty name] is a form field which can decode a required
      value from the form. If at least one value corresponding to the given
      [name] does not appear in the form, and if a [default] value is not
      specified, the decoding fails with an error. *)

  val multiple : int -> (int -> 'a t) -> 'a list t
  (** [multiple n form] is a form which can decode a list of nested form values.
      It tries to decode exactly [n] values and fails if it can't find all of
      them. Assumes that the items are 0-indexed. See {!decode_multiple} for a
      complete example.

      @since 3.10.0 *)

  val ensure :
    string ->
    ('b -> bool) ->
    ('a ty -> string -> 'b t) ->
    'a ty ->
    string ->
    'b t
  (** [ensure message condition field ty name] is a form field which imposes an
      additional [condition] on top of the existing [field]. If the condition
      fails, the result is an error [message]. It is suggested that the
      [message] be a translation key so that the application can be localized to
      different languages. *)

  (** {2 Form decoders} *)

  val ( let* ) : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t
  (** [let* start_date = required unix_tm "start-date"] decodes a form field and
      allows accessing it in the subsequent decoders. Eg:

        let+ end_date = required (unix_tm ~min:start_date) "end-date" in
        ...
      ]}

      However, note that [let*] uses a 'fail-fast' decoding strategy. If there
      is a decoding error, it immediately returns the error without decoding the
      subsequent fields. (Which makes sense if you think about the example
      above.) So, in order to ensure complete error reporting for all fields,
      you would need to use [let+] and [and+].

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val ( let+ ) : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b t
  (** [let+ email = required string "email"] decodes a form field named [email]
      as a [string]. *)

  val ( and+ ) : 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t
  (** [and+ password = required string "password"] continues decoding in an
      existing form declaration and decodes a form field [password] as a
      [string]. *)

  (** [form1 or form2] is [form1] if it succeeds, else [form2]. *)

      {3 Basic functionality}

      {[
        type user =
          { name : string;
            age : int option
          }

        open Dream_html.Form

        let user_form =
          let+ name = required string "name"
          and+ age = optional (int ~min:16) "age" in
          (* Thanks, Australia! *)
          { name; age }

        let dream_form = ["age", "42"; "name", "Bob"]
        let user_result = validate user_form dream_form
      ]}

      Result: [Ok { name = "Bob"; age = Some 42 }]

      Sad path:

      {[
        validate user_form ["age", "none"]
      ]}

      Result:
      [Error [("age", "error.expected.int"); ("name", "error.required")]]

      {3 Repeated values}

      {[
        type plan =
          { id : string;
            features : string list
          }

        let plan_form =
          let+ id = required string "id"
          and+ features = list string "features" in
          { id; features } validate plan_form ["id", "foo"]
      ]}

      Result: [Ok {id = "foo"; features = []}]

      {[
        validate plan_form ["id", "foo"; "features", "f1"; "features", "f2"]
      ]}

      Result: [Ok {id = "foo"; features = ["f1"; "f2"]}]

      Note that the names can be anything, eg ["features[]"] if you prefer.

      {3 Constrained field values}

      {[
        let plan_form =
          let+ id =
            ensure "error.expected.nonempty" (( <> ) "") required string "id"
          and+ features = list string "features" in
          { id; features } validate plan_form ["id", ""]
      ]}

      Result: [Error [("id", "error.expected.nonempty")]]

      {3 Complex validation rules}

      Using chained validation rules where some fields depend on others:

      {[
        type req =
          { id : string;
            years : int option;
            months : int option;
            weeks : int option;
            days : int option
          }

        let req_form =
          let+ id = required string "id" (* Both id... *)
          and+ days, weeks, months, years =
            (* ...and period are required *)
            let* days = optional int "days" in
            let* weeks = optional int "weeks" in
            let* months = optional int "months" in
            let* years = optional int "years" in
            match days, weeks, months, years with
            | None, None, None, None -> error "years" "Please enter a period"
            (* Only one period component is required *)
            | _ -> ok (days, weeks, months, years)
          in
          { id; days; weeks; months; years } validate req []
      ]}

      Result:
      [Error [("years", "Please enter a period"); ("id", "error.required")]]

      {3:decode_multiple Multiple structured values}

      Suppose you have the following form data submitted:

      {[
        item-count: 2
        item[0].id: abc
        item[0].qty: 1
        item[1].id: def
        item[1].qty: 10
        item[1].discount: 25
      ]}

      And you want to decode it into the following types:

      {[
        type item =
          { id : string;
            qty : int;
            discount : int
          }

        type invoice =
          { item_count : int;
            items : item list
          }
      ]}

      First create the indexed invoice item decoder and invoice decoder:

      {[
        let item n =
          let nth name = "item[" ^ string_of_int n ^ "]." ^ name in
          let+ id = required string (nth "id")
          and+ qty = required int (nth "qty")
          and+ discount = required ~default:0 int (nth "discount") in
          { id; qty; discount }

        let invoice =
          let* item_count = required int "item-count" in
          let+ items = multiple item_count item in
          { item_count; items }
      ]}

      Try it:

      {[
        validate invoice
          [ "item[0].id", "abc";
            "item[0].qty", "1";
            "item[1].id", "def";
            "item[1].qty", "10";
            "item[1].discount", "25";
            "item-count", "2" ]
      ]}

      Result:

      {[
        Ok
          { item_count = 2;
            items =
              [ { id = "def"; qty = 10; discount = 25 };
                { id = "abc"; qty = 1; discount = 0 } ]
          }
      ]}

      Validation error:

      {[
        validate invoice
          [ "item[0].qty", "1";
            "item[1].id", "def";
            "item[1].discount", "25";
            "item-count", "2" ]
          Error
          [item [0].id, error.required; item [1].qty, error.required]
      ]} *)

    Refer to {{!Ppx} the PPX documentation} for instructions on using it.

    ⚠️ Due to the way Dream's router works, all parameter captures happen between
    [/] characters and the end of the path (or the [?] character, whichever
    comes first). Eg, [/foo/%s/bar/%d] is valid, but [/foo/%s.%s] (note the dot
    character) is not a valid capture.

    ⚠️ If a route is matched but the data type does not match, a
    [400 Bad Request] response will be returned. The following type conversion
    specs are supported:

    [%s] capture a [string] and pass it to the handler

    [%*s] capture the rest of the path and pass the captured length and string
    to the handler

    [%c] capture a [char]

    [%d] or [%i] capture an [int]

    [%x] capture a hexadecimal [int]

    [%X] capture an uppercase hexadecimal [int]

    [%o] capture an octal [int]

    [%ld] capture an [int32]

    [%Ld] capture an [int64]

    [%f] capture a [float]

    [%B] capture a [bool]

    ⚠️ We are actually using Dream's built-in router, not our own, and Dream's
    router doesn't distinguish between parameter types. So, to Dream both [/%s]
    and [/%d] are the same path. It will route the request to whichever happens
    to be first in the route list, and that one will succeed or fail depending
    on its type and the request target.

      a revision hash based on the file contents, calculated at build time

    [dreamwork] is a CLI tool that helps set up and manage static file paths and
    routes with proper content-based version hashes. The static files will live
    inside a dune component called [static] and in the [static/assets]
    subdirectory. Suppose you have the following directory tree:

    {v
static/
  dune
  assets/
    css/
      app.css
    js/
      app.js
    v}

    The [dune] file defines a [library] component that will make the following
    module available:

    {[
      module Static : sig
        val routes : Dream.route
        (** This route will serve all of the following paths. *)

        module Assets : sig
          module Css : sig
            val app_css : (Dream.response Dream.promise, attr) path
          end

          module Js : sig
            val app_js : (Dream.response Dream.promise, attr) path
          end
        end
      end
    ]}

    So, you can just stick [Static.routes] in your router and it will correctly
    serve the files from the filesystem with an immutable cache of 1 year; and
    you can use [Static.Assets.Css.app_css] and so on in your dream-html markup
    code and it will correctly render with a [?rev=...] query parameter that
    uniquely identifies this revision of the file with a content-based hash for
    cache-busting purposes:

    {[
      link [rel "stylesheet"; path_attr href Static.Assets.Css.app_css
      (*
      <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="/static/assets/css/app.css?rev=17fb8161afc85df86156ea1f3744c8a2"
      >
      *)
    ]}

    {[
      script [path_attr src Static.Assets.Js.app_js] ""
      (*
      <script src="/static/assets/js/app.js?rev=677645e5ac37d683c5039a85c41c339f">
      </script>
      *)
    ]}

    You control the directory subtree under [assets]; the [dreamwork] CLI just
    helps you define the [dune] component that generates the above module
    structure. The module structure mirrors the directory tree structure.

    The entry point to [dreamwork] is the [dreamwork setup] command, which
    creates [static/], [assets/], and [dune]. In the [dune] file it defines a
    code generation rule which uses the [dreamwork static] command to generate
    the OCaml code.

    So, you just need to run [dreamwork setup] to initialize the directory
    structure and code generation. After that, you can add and remove any files
    inside [assets/] as you want and on the next dune build the [Static] module
    structure will be updated accordingly.

(** Live reload script injection and handling. Adapted from [Dream.livereload]
    middleware. This version is not a middleware so it's not as plug-and-play as
    that, but on the other hand it's much simpler to implement because it uses
    type-safe dream-html nodes rather than parsing and printing raw HTML. See
    below for the 3-step process to use it.
