(** {2 Input} *)

(** Typed, extensible HTML form decoder with error reporting for form field
    validation failures. Powerful chained decoding functionality–the validation
    of one field can depend on the values of other decoded fields.

    See the bottom of the page for complete examples.

    @since 3.7.0. *)
module Form : sig
  (** {2 Basic type decoders} *)

  type 'a ty = string -> ('a, string) result
  (** The type of a decoder for a single form field value of type ['a] which can
      successfully decode the field value or fail with an error message key. *)

  (** In the following type decoders, the minimum and maximum values are all
      {i inclusive}. *)

  val bool : bool ty
  val char : ?min:char -> ?max:char -> char ty
  val float : ?min:float -> ?max:float -> float ty
  val int : ?min:int -> ?max:int -> int ty
  val int32 : ?min:int32 -> ?max:int32 -> int32 ty
  val int64 : ?min:int64 -> ?max:int64 -> int64 ty
  val string : ?min_length:int -> ?max_length:int -> string ty

  val unix_tm : ?min:Unix.tm -> ?max:Unix.tm -> Unix.tm ty
  (** This can parse strings with the formats [2024-01-01] or
      [2024-01-01T00:00:00] into a timestamp.

      Note that this is {i not} timezone-aware.

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  (** {2 Forms and fields} *)

  type 'a t
  (** The type of a form (a form field by itself is also considered a form)
      which can decode values of type ['a] or fail with a list of error message
      keys. *)

  val ok : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [ok value] is a form field that always successfully returns [value].

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val error : string -> string -> 'a t
  (** [error name message] is a form field that always errors the field [name]
      with the [message].

      These allow adding adding further checks to the entire form using all
      decoded field values and then attaching more errors to specific fields (or
      not).

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val list : ?min_length:int -> ?max_length:int -> 'a ty -> string -> 'a list t
  (** [list ?min_length ?max_length ty name] is a form field which can decode a
      list of values which can each be decoded by [ty]. The list must have at
      least [min_length] and at most [max_length] (inclusive). *)

  val optional : 'a ty -> string -> 'a option t
  (** [optional ty name] is a form field which can decode an optional value from
      the form. *)

  val required : ?default:'a -> 'a ty -> string -> 'a t
  (** [required ?default ty name] is a form field which can decode a required
      value from the form. If at least one value corresponding to the given
      [name] does not appear in the form, and if a [default] value is not
      specified, the decoding fails with an error. *)

  val ensure :
    string ->
    ('b -> bool) ->
    ('a ty -> string -> 'b t) ->
    'a ty ->
    string ->
    'b t
  (** [ensure message condition field ty name] is a form field which imposes an
      additional [condition] on top of the existing [field]. If the condition
      fails, the result is an error [message]. It is suggested that the [message]
      be a translation key so that the application can be localized to different
      languages. *)

  (** {2 Form decoders} *)

  val ( let* ) : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t
  (** [let* start_date = required unix_tm "start-date"] decodes a form field and
      allows accessing it in the subsequent decoders. Eg:

      {[
      let* start_date = required unix_tm "start-date" in
      let+ end_date = required (unix_tm ~min:start_date) "end-date" in
      ...
      ]}

      However, note that [let*] uses a 'fail-fast' decoding strategy. If there is
      a decoding error, it immediately returns the error without decoding the
      subsequent fields. (Which makes sense if you think about the example above.)
      So, in order to ensure complete error reporting for all fields, you would
      need to use [let+] and [and+].

      @since 3.8.0 *)

  val ( let+ ) : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b t
  (** [let+ email = required string "email"] decodes a form field named [email]
      as a [string]. *)

  val ( and+ ) : 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t
  (** [and+ password = required string "password"] continues decoding in an
      existing form declaration and decodes a form field [password] as a [string]. *)

  val ( or ) : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [form1 or form2] is [form1] if it succeeds, else [form2]. *)

  val validate :
    'a t -> (string * string) list -> ('a, (string * string) list) result
  (** [validate form values] is a result of validating the given [form]'s
      [values]. It may be either some value of type ['a] or a list of form field
      names and the corresponding error message keys. *)

  val pp_error : (string * string) list Fmt.t
  (** [pp_error] is a helper pretty-printer for debugging/troubleshooting form
      validation errors. *)

  (** {2 Error keys}

      When errors are reported, the following keys are used instead of English
      strings. These keys can be used for localizing the error messages. The
      suggested default English translations are given below.

      These keys are modelled after
      {{:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/6f5129e6e3b9c784948b56d486d1ef1e5efef163/core/play/src/main/resources/messages.default}
       Play Framework}. *)

  val error_expected_bool : string
  (** Please enter [true] or [false]. *)

  val error_expected_char : string
  (** Please enter a single character. *)

  val error_expected_single : string
  (** Please enter a single value. *)

  val error_expected_int : string
  (** Please enter a valid integer. *)

  val error_expected_int32 : string
  (** Please enter a valid 32-bit integer. *)

  val error_expected_int64 : string
  (** Please enter a valid 64-bit integer. *)

  val error_expected_number : string
  (** Please enter a valid number. *)

  val error_expected_time : string
  (** Please enter a valid date or date-time. *)

  val error_length : string
  (** Please enter a value of the expected length. *)

  val error_range : string
  (** Please enter a value in the expected range. *)

  val error_required : string
  (** Please enter a value. *)

  (** {2 Examples}

      Basic complete example:

      {[
      type user = { name : string; age : int option }

      open Dream_html.Form

      let user_form =
        let+ name = required string "name"
        and+ age = optional (int ~min:16) "age" in
        (* Thanks, Australia! *)
        { name; age }

      let dream_form = ["age", "42"; "name", "Bob"]
      let user_result = validate user_form dream_form
      ]}

      Result: [Ok { name = "Bob"; age = Some 42 }]

      Sad path:

      {[validate user_form ["age", "none"]]}

      Result:
      [Error [("age", "error.expected.int"); ("name", "error.required")]]

      Decode list of values from form:

      {[
      type plan = { id : string; features : string list }

      let plan_form =
        let+ id = required string "id"
        and+ features = list string "features" in
        { id; features }

      validate plan_form ["id", "foo"]
      ]}

      Result: [Ok {id = "foo"; features = []}]

      {[validate plan_form ["id", "foo"; "features", "f1"; "features", "f2"]]}

      Result: [Ok {id = "foo"; features = ["f1"; "f2"]}]

      Note that the names can be anything, eg ["features[]"] if you prefer.

      Add further requirements to field values:

      {[
      let plan_form =
        let+ id = ensure "error.expected.nonempty" (( <> ) "") required string "id"
        and+ features = list string "features" in
        { id; features }

      validate plan_form ["id", ""]
      ]}

      Result: [Error [("id", "error.expected.nonempty")]]

      Complex validation rules with multiple fields:

      {[
      type req = {
        id : string;
        years : int option;
        months : int option;
        weeks : int option;
        days : int option;
      }

      let req_form =
        let+ id = required string "id" (* Both id... *)
        and+ days, weeks, months, years = (* ...and period are required *)
          let* days = optional int "days" in
          let* weeks = optional int "weeks" in
          let* months = optional int "months" in
          let* years = optional int "years" in
          match days, weeks, months, years with
          | None, None, None, None -> error "years" "Please enter a period"
          (* Only one period component is required *)
          | _ -> ok (days, weeks, months, years)
        in
        { id; days; weeks; months; years }

      validate req []
      ]}

      Result: [Error [("years", "Please enter a period"); ("id", "error.required")]]
      *)
end

  Dream.request ->
  [> 'a Dream.form_result | `Invalid of (string * string) list] Dream.promise
(** Type-safe wrapper for [Dream.form]. Similarly to that, you can match on the

      | _ -> Dream.empty `Bad_Request
    ]}

(** {2 Live reload support} *)

(** Live reload script injection and handling. Adapted from [Dream.livereload]
    middleware. This version is not a middleware so it's not as plug-and-play as
    that, but on the other hand it's much simpler to implement because it uses
    type-safe dream-html nodes rather than parsing and printing raw HTML. See
    below for the 3-step process to use it.

    This module is adapted from Dream, released under the MIT license. For
    details, visit {:https://github.com/aantron/dream}.

      means that the [route] will respond with [404] status and the script will
      be omitted from the rendered HTML. *)
end

(** {2 Type-safe routing} *)

(** Bidirectional routes with type-safe path segment parsing and printing using
    OCaml's built-in format strings, and support for scoped middleware.

    @since v3.9.0 *)
module Route : sig
  type (_, _) t
  (** A route that can handle a templated request path and also print the filled
      value of the templated path using its parameters.

      The first type parameter represents the type of the request handler. Eg, if
      the format string is ["/foo"], the handler will have type
      [Dream.request -> Dream.response Dream.promise]. If the format string is
      ["/foo/%s"], the handler will have type
      [Dream.request -> string -> Dream.response Dream.promise], and so on
      depending on the type specifiers in the format string.

      The second type parameter represents the type of the [link] attribute
      printer. Eg, if the format string is ["/foo"], the printer will have type
      [Dream_html.attr]. If the format string is ["/foo/%s"], the printer will
      have type [string -> Dream_html.attr], and so on. *)

  val make :
    ?meth:Dream.method_ ->
    ('r, unit, Dream.response Dream.promise) format ->
    ('p, unit, string, attr) format4 ->
    (Dream.request -> 'r) ->
    ('r, 'p) t
  (** [make ?meth request_fmt attr_fmt handler] is a route which handles requests
      with [meth] if specified, or any method otherwise.

      @param request_fmt format string is used to match against requests. It
        accepts the following format specifiers:

        [%s] matches against any sequence of characters upto (excluding) a [/].

        [%*s] matches against the rest of the path, and then passes as handler
        params the number of characters captured as well as the captured
        substring. This can be used as a catch-all, eg to respond with a
        customized 'not found' message.

        [%d] matches against any integer.

        [%c] matches against any single character.

        [%%] at the {i end} of the route format string matches against an
        optional trailing [/] character, allowing you to flexibly handle requests
        either way.

      @param attr_fmt format string is used to print out the filled value of the
        route with its parameters as a dream-html typed attribute. The two are
        different because they must be specified as literals and have different
        types for parsing and printing.

      @param handler takes the Dream request and any parameters that are parsed
        from the path as arguments and returns a Dream response.

      Examples:

      {[
      let get_account_version =
        make
          ~meth:`GET
          "/accounts/%s/versions/%d"
          "/accounts/%s/versions/%d"
          (fun _req acc ver ->
            Dream.html (Printf.sprintf "Account: %s, version: %d" acc ver))

      let get_order =
        make ~meth:`GET "/orders/%s" "/orders/%s" (fun _ id -> Dream.html id)
      ]} *)

  val format : (_, _) t -> string
  (** [format route] is the template string used to match request paths against
      the [route]. *)

  val link : (_, 'p) t -> ('p, unit, string, attr) format4
  (** [link route] is a dream-html attribute value that prints out the filled
      path of the [route] given its parameters. Use this instead of hard-coding
      your route URLs throughout your app, to make it easy to refactor routes
      with minimal effort.

      Eg:

      {[
      open Dream_html
      open HTML

      a [href (Route.link get_order) "yzxyzc"] [txt "My Order"]
      ]}

      Renders: [<a href="/orders/yzxyzc">My Order</a>] *)

  val handler : (_, _) t -> Dream.handler
  (** [handler route] converts the [route] into a Dream handler. *)

  val ( || ) : (_, _) t -> (_, _) t -> (Dream.response Dream.promise, attr) t
  (** [route1 || route2] joins together [route1] and [route2] into a new route so
      that requests targeting either of them will match. Use this to build your
      app's routes. Eg, in Dream your routes might look like:

      {[
      Dream.router [
        Dream.get "/echo/:word" Echo.get;
        Dream.post "/echo/:word" Echo.post;
      ]
      ]}

      With [( || )] it would look like:

      {[
      (* echo.ml *)
      open Route

      let get = make ~meth:`GET "/echo/%s" "/echo/%s" (fun _ word ->
        Dream.html word)

      let post = make ~meth:`POST "/echo/%s" "/echo/%s" (fun _ word ->
        Dream.html ~status:`Created word)

      (* main.ml *)
      handler (
        Echo.get ||
        Echo.post
      )
      ]} *)

  val ( && ) : Dream.middleware -> Dream.middleware -> Dream.middleware
  (** [middleware1 && middleware2] joins together two Dream middlewares so that
      [middleware1] is applied first, then [middleware2]. *)

  val scope :
    ( int -> string -> 'r,
      unit,
      Dream.response Dream.promise,
      int -> string -> Dream.response Dream.promise )
    format4 ->
    ('d, unit, string, 'e) format4 ->
    ((Dream.request -> Dream.response Dream.promise) -> Dream.request -> 'r) ->
    (_, 'e) t ->
    (int -> string -> 'r, 'd) t
  (** [scope request_prefix attr_prefix middleware route] is a route that matches
      against paths which have a [request_prefix], and handles those requests by
      applying the [middleware] and the [route] handler. Eg:

      {[
      let add_header prev req =
        let open Lwt.Syntax in
        let+ resp = prev req in
        Dream.add_header resp "X-Api-Server" "Dream";
        resp

      let get_order =
        make ~meth:`GET "/orders/%s" "/orders/%s" (fun _ id -> Dream.html id)

      let get_order_v2 = scope "/v2" "/v2" add_header get_order
      ]}

      In the example above, [get_order_v2] will match against requests with paths
      like "/v2/orders/%s", then strip out the [/v2] prefix, apply the
      [add_header] middleware, and handle the request with the [get_order] route.

      ⚠️ However, be aware that adding a scope on top of an existing route does
      not change that route's path, so eg if you use the [get_order] route to
      print links, but route against the [get_order_v2] route, the links will not
      work.

      @param attr_prefix is used to prefix the route link correctly as well when
        it is printed as an attribute. *)

  val pp : (_, _) t Fmt.t
  (** [pp] is a formatter that prints out a simple summary of the route, eg
      [GET /foo/%s] or just [/foo/%s] if the route matches any method. *)
end
