(** This PPX provides an extension point to create route paths.

    You can add it to your [dune] file in the usual way:
    [(preprocess (pps dream-html.ppx))].

    Then create a path: [let%path orders = "/orders"].

    And use it in a route: [Dream_html.get orders (fun req -> ...)].

    The PPX expands the above path to:

    {[
      let orders = Dream_html.path "/orders" "/orders"
    ]}

    Ie, it just duplicates the path string to use as two separate format strings
    with different types for parsing and printing. If you need to actually have
    a different format string for printing (eg if you need to print the path
    with query parameters), you can use the underlying {!Dream_html.path}
    function directly:
    [path "/orders/%s" "/orders/%s?utm_src=%s&utm_campaign=%s"].

    @since 3.9.0 *)
